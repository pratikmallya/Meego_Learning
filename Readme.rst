Learning Meego
==============
This repository documents my process of learning development for the 
Nokia N9 (Meego OS)

Why A Git Repository?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Git repositories are 
meant for storing code, but many times I need to access the notes I'd 
written at home from the office or vice versa, the inability to do which
leaves me with a lot of frustration. So, I thought of using github;
so easy why did I not think of this before?

Why Learn Meego/Harmattan Development?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(This is here to convince the future me why this is a great idea)
Because its the best platform I've seen yet; and the Nokia N9 swipe
interface is the most attractive, seductive UI that I've ever seen.
It is said that beauty is the weakness of men, so be it. Although it 
seems that Qt is dead, this is something that I still really want to 
do. And as long as its my own spare time that I'm burning, I'll continue
to do so

What does this repository contain?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Sample code that I play around with, simple projects that I create, 
planning document. The overall aim is to get a native-like port of qgvdial.
I.e integrate it as tightly as Skype is so that making calls from gvoice
is just as easy :)
